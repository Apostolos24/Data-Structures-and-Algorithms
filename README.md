# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms
### About this project:
This repo contains (or more appropriately *will* contain in the future) a collection of:
- Data Structures
- Algorithms 

They are written in C++ but I plan to expand to other languages in the *near* future.

These implementations can be used for educational purposes or used as a library for development.
Any contribution is welcome.

### Behind this project:
This is my personal repo containing some data structures and algorithms that I have coded, partly because I like playing around with them and to practice, partly because I can have them already developed and able to be used for future projects. I might make a library out of them in the future :)
Any help or feedback is appreciated!

I am new in Github and still learning. This is my first attempt at an actual repo.
This repo will be constantly updated and getting better as I learn.
